Challenges I faced while working on this project was making the project in my own way. Any time that I was faced with a challenge in terms of coding it was simple to find a guide to troubleshoot what was wrong with my code other than finding ways to customize aspects of the game. Additionally, I had never made a game or used pygame before so I would still say that the biggest challenge I faced was installing pygame as I had to create a path and command prompt to install compatiable versions of pygame and python. This project was fun to make I felt very accomplished with myself as my code successfully and I was able to have it run and be customizable.
