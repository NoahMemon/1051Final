# 1051Final

I want to work towards creating a project known as the Snake Game but add some additional parts that are exclusive to my version. 

I plan to work alone

It will be a game, playable in idle or python in general, in which the player "the snake" gets food to score points. 

My project will be coded enough to allow for customization of perhaps the snake, score multiplier, color, board size. I plan to code the project in IDLE because it is what I am most comfortable with. 

A good outcome is that the snake is able to eat food to get points

A better outcome is that the user can fully control the snake and the game works as intended. 

Best outcome is that the snake is able to be customized as well as many other aspects of the game. 

I will need to learn how to incorporate movement into inputs. And figure out how to allow for the user to customize.
